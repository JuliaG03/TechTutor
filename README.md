# TechTutor 
Tech Tutor is a mobile app designed to provide bite-sized tutorials for computer science topics!
It is optimized and thought for on-the-go learning. 

The app offers a diverse range of learning paths covering programming languages, algorithms, and more.

 - Bite-sized Tutorials: Access quick and effective tutorials on various computer science topics.

 - Leaderboard: Compete with other learners and climb the leaderboard by earning points.

 - Learning Paths: Choose from different learning paths tailored to your skill level and interests.

 - Chat Integration: Engage with the support team if you have any problem. We will get to you as soon as possible.

## Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

In the development and debugging phases of our app implementation, we leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance our productivity and solve complex problems. Here's how we utilized LLMs in various stages of our project:

### Debugging

Throughout the implementation, we encountered issues with poorly written functions that did not perform as expected. In such cases, we turned to BlackBox.ai for assistance in identifying and fixing the problems in our code.

### Implementation Ideas

There were times when we had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve but were unsure of how to get there. ChatGPT proved invaluable by providing step-by-step guidance on various topics, including:

- Choosing compatible programming languages
- Running our mobile app on different devices for testing
- Suggesting additional app pages beyond our initial plan
- Recommending color palettes for the app design
- (I'll ask ChatGPT later for more ideas to include here ðŸ˜‰)

## Run Locally our app with Expo

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
